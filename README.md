# ScopeWarden

## Introduction
ScopeWarden is a self-hostable and configurable automated recon tool. It allows you to automate your workflow without relying on any specific recon tool, and customize the way each scan runs. 

## Features
- **Run any recon tool:** The yaml configuration file allows you to set any command for the scan to run, and a way to filter results such that only the relevant output gets considered.
- **Run port scans on found assets:** Each found domain from the recon tool can be port scanned, and the configuration allows you to set specific ports to avoid collecting noise. Alternatively, it can run a complete port scan for each found domain.
- **Conditional bruteforce**: Each tool can be configured to use a brute force tool (e.g. ffuf, gobuster, etc.), which can itself be configured to run based on the technologies found on the domain (e.g. php, wordpress, apache, etc.)
- **Update messages:** Can be configured to send Telegram messages if a new or previously unavailable domain/port becomes available.

## Setup
### Daemon & API
The scan daemon and API will automatically start running if you installed it with `make install-daemon`.
If you installed it via go install, follow these steps:

### Telegram Notifications
In order to reduce dependencies, ScopeWarden relies on your own Telegram bot and chat ID. To set this up, check the following documentation:
- *Set up bot token:* https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather
- *To get your chat ID:* https://gist.github.com/nafiesl/4ad622f344cd1dc3bb1ecbe468ff9f8a#get-chat-id-for-a-private-chat

## Configuration
By default, ScopeWarden will not run any tools in the scan. It will continuously loop trying to find the desired configuration yaml file.
The yaml file can contain the folliwng:
This configuration file defines global settings, tools, scanning options, and parsing rules for automated recon.

### Global Settings
- **schedule**: Interval in hours for running scans (e.g., `12` runs every 12 hours).  
- **notify**: `true` or `false` — enable Telegram notifications.

### Tools
Each tool is defined under the `tools` section with the following fields:
- **id**: Unique identifier for the tool (e.g., `gau`).  
- **command**: CLI command to run. It supports the placeholder `<target>` for the target URL.  
- **verbose**: `true` or `false`. Enables stderr logging for the tool.

#### Port Scanning
Optional port scanning configuration:
- **run**: `true` or `false` — enable port scanning.  
- **ports**: List of ports to scan. If empty/non-existing, ScopeWarden will run a port scan with no specified ports. (e.g., `21, 22, 53`).  

#### Brute Force / Fuzzing
Optional brute-force configuration:
- **run**: `true` or `false` — enable brute force scans.  
- **command**: The fuzzing command. It supports placeholders`<target>` for the target URL and `<wordlist>` representing the path of the worlist to use.  
- **regex**: Regex to filter valid results from fuzzing output.
- **conditions**: Optional list of technology-specific wordlists:
  - **technology**: Target technology to run the scan. This is not case-sensitive. (e.g., `php`, `wordpress`).
  - **wordlist**: Path to the wordlist to use for that technology.

#### Output Parser
Defines how the tool output is processed:
- **type**: `realtime` (parse output as it is produced) or `file` (parse after completion, reading from an output file).  
- **regex**: Regular expression to extract relevant information from the tool output.  

### Example
```
yaml
global:
  schedule: 12
  notify: true

tools:
  - id: gau
    command: 'gau <target>'
    table: 'domain'
    target_table: 'scope'
    verbose: false
    port_scan:
      run: true
      ports:
        - 21
        - 22
        - 53
    brute_force:
      run: true
      command: 'ffuf -u <target>/FUZZ -w <wordlist> -s -rate 5'
      regex: '^[^\/\r\n\\]+\.[^\/\r\n\\]+$'
      conditions:
        - technology: 'php'
          wordlist: '/path/to/php-wordlist.txt'
    parser:
      type: 'realtime'
      regex: '^(https?:\/\/)?([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})(:\d+)?(\/[^\r\n]*)?$'
```

## Usage
### CLI
The CLI allows you to add targets and scopes, as well as view the recon results per target in a interactive table.
#### Insert Target
`scopewarden -iT <TARGET_NAME>`
```
scopewarden -iT NASA
```

#### Insert Scope
`scopewarden -iS <TARGET_NAME>,<COMMA_SEPARATED_SCOPE_LIST>`
Example:
```
scopewarden -iS NASA,nasa.gov,something.com,somethingelse.com
```

#### View Table
`scopewarden -t <TARGET_NAME>`
Example:
```
scopewarden -t NASA
```
#### Navigating interactive table:
The first table displayed when running -t is the domains table. It shows all domains found when running the configured tools and the status code it received when testing the domain. To navigate the table:
- **[J,K]**: Used for naviating up and down the tables
- **[H,L]**: Used for going back and forward 1 page
- **[P]**: Used to switch to the ports table. It displays the ports found for the selected domain when running the configured port scan and their respective port states. 
- **[A]**: Used to show the results of the brute forced results for the selected domain.
- **[B]**: Used to go back to the main table.
